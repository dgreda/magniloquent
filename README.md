Magniloquent
============

Self-validating models for Laravel 4's Eloquent.

Based on the excellent [Ardent](https://github.com/laravelbook/ardent) package by [Max Ehsan](https://github.com/laravelbook).

This package is highly inspired by Ardent. I wanted to make some big changes and so I thought it would be better to start a new package rather than fundamentally change how Ardent validates data.

##Installation

Add `laravelbook/ardent` as a requirement to `composer.json`:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "magniloquent/magniloquent": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Update your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.
